        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This pumpkin spice cake recipe is sure to be a hit with anyone who loves spice cakes. 
            Even if your family doesn't like pumpkin, I promise they'll never know there's pumpkin in this delicious cake! Studded with nutty pecans, 
            this moist spice cake would be delicious topped with a cream cheese frosting or maple glaze. I even used this recipe for cupcakes at Thanksgiving 
            so everyone could get a little more cream cheese frosting.
